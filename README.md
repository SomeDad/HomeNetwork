# Home Network
A small piece about setting up my first home network. 

Initially I was going to create my home Network with a RAID 0 setup for storage, with the purpose of having a safe space to securely save important files and photo's.
After a bit of research and speaking to a few people, I've decided that I will most likely set up the Network as a ZFS file system.

Next step is to figure out what I will need to have / buy to set this up properly.
